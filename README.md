# Employee Performance Data Analysis

### Project Overview

This project performs an **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on a dataset that contains information about employee performance, sales, attendance, and customer satisfaction across various departments. The goal of this analysis is to gain insights into factors affecting employee performance, identify top performers, and evaluate how key metrics such as attendance, sales, and customer satisfaction are interrelated.

### Dataset Information

The dataset contains the following columns:
- **Employee ID**: Unique identifier for each employee.
- **Name**: Employee's name.
- **Department**: The department to which the employee belongs (e.g., Sales, Marketing, Customer Service).
- **Sales ($)**: The total sales generated by the employee in dollars.
- **Performance Rating**: A numerical rating of the employee's performance (e.g., 1.0 to 5.0).
- **Attendance (%)**: The employee's attendance rate as a percentage.
- **Customer Satisfaction (1-5)**: Average customer satisfaction rating (1 being the lowest and 5 the highest).
- **Tasks Completed**: The number of tasks the employee has completed.
- **Overtime Hours**: The number of overtime hours the employee has worked.

### Key Questions Explored

The analysis aims to answer the following questions:

1. **Sales Performance**:
   - What is the average sales performance for each department?
   - Who are the top 5 employees based on sales generated?
   - Is there a correlation between sales and performance ratings?

2. **Attendance and Performance**:
   - How does attendance affect performance ratings?
   - Do employees with higher attendance have better customer satisfaction ratings?

3. **Customer Satisfaction**:
   - Which employees have the highest customer satisfaction ratings?
   - Are customer satisfaction scores higher in certain departments?

4. **Tasks and Efficiency**:
   - How does the number of tasks completed correlate with performance ratings?
   - Is there a relationship between tasks completed and overtime hours worked?

### Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

Several steps were taken to clean and preprocess the data before analysis:

1. **Handling Missing Values**:
   - Missing values in `Sales ($)` and `Performance Rating` columns were handled using mean imputation for relevant departments.
   - For other columns, such as `Customer Satisfaction` and `Overtime Hours`, we either excluded missing data from certain calculations or used median values to fill gaps.

2. **Duplicate Entries**:
   - Some duplicate entries, such as repeated Employee IDs, were identified and removed to ensure data integrity.

3. **Outliers**:
   - Outliers in `Sales ($)` and `Overtime Hours` were visually inspected and handled using z-score or interquartile range (IQR) methods where necessary.

4. **Data Types**:
   - The dataset was checked for correct data types (e.g., numeric types for `Sales`, `Performance Rating`, `Tasks Completed`, etc.).

### Analysis and Methods

The following methods and techniques were used in the analysis:

- **GroupBy and Aggregation**: Used to group data by `Department` and `Employee ID`, applying functions like `sum()`, `mean()`, and `count()` to answer key questions.
  
- **Pivot Tables**: Created pivot tables to compare metrics such as sales and performance across departments.
  
- **Correlation Analysis**: Correlation analysis was done to explore the relationships between variables such as `Attendance (%)`, `Sales ($)`, and `Customer Satisfaction`.
  
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib and Seaborn were used to create visualizations such as bar charts, scatter plots, and heatmaps to illustrate key findings.

### Results and Insights

1. **Top Performers**:
   - The top 5 sales performers were identified, with a clear lead in the `Sales` department.
   - Employees with higher customer satisfaction ratings often had above-average performance ratings and sales.

2. **Attendance Impact**:
   - A positive correlation between attendance and performance ratings was observed, though the relationship was not perfect.
   - Departments with higher attendance rates tended to have better overall performance.

3. **Departmental Performance**:
   - The `Sales` department consistently outperformed `Marketing` and `Customer Service` in terms of revenue generated.
   - Customer satisfaction was highest in the `Sales` and `Customer Service` departments, while `Marketing` showed lower average ratings.
